The `react-checkbox-tree` component requires icons.

It uses FontAwesome icons by default.
These must be fetched at run-time from the network, or installed as an npm dependency.

Instead of using FontAwesome I use the icons in this folder, which I download individually from:

- https://fonts.google.com/icons
