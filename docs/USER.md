## File menu

When you open the application for the first time, it asks you to open a data source.

There's a File menu to open data. It has two menu items.

### Directory containing binary .NET assemblies

Use this to select a directory, which contains .NET assemblies:

- The `bin\*` directory which contains the results of a project's or a solution's build
- Or an installation directory, which contains installed assemblies
- (or a local copy of the installation directory)

In this case the tool will read these assemblies, using the .NET Reflection APIs.

### JSON file containing `id` and `dependencies`

Use this to select a JSON file, which contains the data to display.

Creating this file is out-of-scope: you may create it manually.

The format of this file must be as follows:

- It contains an array of nodes
- Each node is an object with the following fields:
  - `id` required, must be unique
  - `label` optional, default is the `id` value
  - `tags` optional, an array of strings
  - `dependencies` required, an array of objects with required `id` and `label` fields
- Any node or dependency may have other optional named properties, whose type is one of `string`, `number`, or `boolean`

Here is a TypeScript definition:

```ts
type Scalar = "string" | "number" | "boolean";

interface IOtherFields {
  [key: string]: Scalar;
}

type CustomNode = IOtherFields & {
  id: string;
  label?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  dependencies: [{ id: string; label: string } & IOtherFields];
};

type CustomData = CustomNode[];
```

## Database

After data is loaded, the program creates SQLite databases which contain the data, in this folder

- `C:\Users\`_(username)_`\AppData\Roaming\apis\app_data`

So reopening the same data store is quick -- except if the data has changed --
if a file is newer than the database then the data is read again and reloaded into the database.

The database also contains view state -- e.g. which nodes are visible --
so this too persists to the next session, unless you delete the database.

## Display

### Example

Here's an example of its showing a solution which contains 10 projects

![Alt text](./screenshots.tiny/Screenshot%202024-01-28%20093001.png)

Unlike this example, the solution which you want to browse might contain hundreds of nodes.

### Object graph

The loaded data is displayed as an object graph in the central pane of the UI.
It's a tree not just a graph, if the dependencies are acyclic.

- The graph can be resized (zoomed) using the mouse-wheel.
- The image is created using Graphviz (which tries to optimize the layout of the graph)
- Graphviz also produces an image map, so the elements (i.e. nodes and edges) react to `onClick` and `onHover` events

### Node checkboxes

Every node has a corresponding checkbox in the left-hand pane.

When you enable or disable a checkbox then the graph is redrawn, with or without the corresponding node.

### Node groups

Nodes may be grouped (into "node groups" or "groups of nodes").

This feature is essential, without it a graph with hundreds of nodes would be unreadable.

The algorithms and UI to specify how nodes are grouped is still a feature-in-progress

- In the example shown above, they are grouped by namespace -- so the `System.*` namespaces are in a `System` group.
- Others are to-do.

The grouping is shown by the checkboxes being arranged in a tree:

- Enabling or disabling a group does so for all the child nodes in the group
- The checkbox state of the group reflects the state of all its children
