# Rescaling with the mouse wheel

You can resize the graph (in the central pane) and the text (in the left and right panes), using the mouse wheel:

- Mouse wheel in the central pane to resize the graph
- `[Ctrl]` key and mouse wheel in the left-hand pane to resize the text

Screenshots on this page use text size `12px` (instead of the default `16px`), and graph size `45%` (instead of `100%`).
